# 04-HW-CODEQUIZ
# Started by setting my Index HTMl.
# First I made my header which contains my HighScore button and my 60s Timer
# Followed by setting my main up which consists of my acutal quiz
# Enable a event listener that starts to countdown the timer as well as starting the quiz
# Added in the function to make the quiz title and start button display hidden when quiz begins on click.
# Able to fix timer issue where it would go directly to 3secs and not respond on page and only show countdown on console.
# Triggered first question to come after starting quiz.
